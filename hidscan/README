	git clone git://github.com/signal11/hidapi.git
Please refer to README.HIDAPI for details.

This code currently assumes a specific USB HID device as follows.
     (VendorID, ProductID) = (0x05fe, 0x1010)

Make sure your HID raw device can be opened by normal users.
This can be achived by adding a udev rule like this.
  # cp etc/50-usb-hid.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
  # /etc/init.d/udev restart
